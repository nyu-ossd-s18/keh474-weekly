I selected the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appa_(character)> article to edit for my contribution to Wikipeida. I chose to contribute to this article because I am a big fan of the series Avatar: The Last Airbender. 

My contribution was to add a link to the first occurrence of Aang’s name. I chose to add this link because Appa is Aang’s sky bison, so it is important to have their connection readily available in the article.
