### Team Assesment and Plan

Django Team: Jessica Fushada, Kelly Hogan, Rohit Motwani, Shiyang Wang, Kenneth Yang

**Based on the team, what are the strenghts and weaknesses of the team in terms of being able to participate in the project you selected? (Use your team-mates blog posts to asses their strengths and weaknesses)**

  **Stengths**
  * Previous experience working with Django
  * Experience with Git and GitHub
  * Strong Python skills
  * Open to new ideas
  * Teamwork and communication 
  
  **Weaknessness**
  * Lack of confidence in our ability to contribute in a meaningful way
  * Inexperience with large-scale software development

**Come up with a common meeting time (2 hours block outside of class) to which all team members can commit. Come up with an alternative meeting time (2 hours block outside of
class) to which all team members can commit - the second time slot will serve as an alternative for weeks during which the first time slot does not work and as a second meeting time during weeks when you need to be able to spend more time working together.**

  Our tentative meeting times are:
  * Thursday 5-7 PM
  * (Alternative) Tuesday 5-7 PM

**Create a list of milestones that you need to achieve in order to be able to successfully contribute to the project you selected.**

  * Become familiar with Django and all the documentation/code of conduct rules/style rules
  * Join the mailing list and IRC chat
  * Install the development version of Django
  * Look through the issues labeled under “easy-pickings” and try to find a solution and make a pull request
  * Eventually move on to more difficult issues

### Team repositories:

1. Create a team repository with the fork of the project that your team selected
[Django fork](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/django)

2. Create another team repository that will be used for coordinating work on the project (use the project board to set up your milestones)

### Contributions

**Wikipedia**

1. [Edit character page for Appa](<https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Appa_(character)&oldid=825221947>) 

My contribution was to add a link to the first occurrence of Aang’s name. I chose to add this link because Appa is Aang’s sky bison, so it is important to have their connection readily available in the article. 

**Course Website**

2. Report an issue - [Link to issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/42)

On the home page under Important Dates, the phrase should be "Midterm Exam (these dates may change if there are any schedule changes):", but on the website it was "Midterm Exam (these dates may change is there are any schedule changes):"

3. [Comment on an issue #41](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/41)
4. Create a pull request  - [Link to pull request](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/72) for issue [#18](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/18)
