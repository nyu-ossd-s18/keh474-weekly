### Questions for Danna

1. What is Google doing to promote Open Source Projects? 
2. How do you use your 20% time at Google? 
3. How does Open Source work at Google and how involved is it in Chromium?

### Describe the progress that you group made in working on the project, are you (as an individual) able to actively participate in what the group is working on? what are your specific task in the work on the project?

Since [last week](https://nyu-ossd-s18.github.io/keh474-weekly/week08/) our group [Django](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/django-team) has continued to monitor Django for tickets that we would be able to solve. We looked at tickets [28667](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/28667) and [29122](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29122). 

My specific tasks have been to look for alterative projects and look at the IRC chat. Some contenders for alternative projects that I have found include [Karrot](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend) and [Hyper](https://github.com/zeit/hyper). These have a lot of "good first issue" tickets" and the communities seem friendly and active.

### Report on any additional contributions

This week I commented on [Issue #98](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/98) and started working on a Pull Request to resolve it.
