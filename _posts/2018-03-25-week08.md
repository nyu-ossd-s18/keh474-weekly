### HFOSS

**According to the Merrian Webster dictionary, the definition of the word humanitarian (adj) is "relating to or characteristic of people who work to improve the lives and living conditions of other people". Consider the open source projects that you are familiar with (not necesserily the one that you are working on in this class). Could any of them  be classified as humanitarian  or having humanitarian aspect? Explain.**

Open source projects that I am familiar with such as [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) and [Opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) are projects that I would not consider to be humanitarian because while they give the user tools to perform complex math operations, they do little for the hummanitarian cause and will not be useful in a disaster.   
 
### Group Project [Django Team](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/django-team/blob/master/minutes-2018-03-22.md)

**Report on the progress that you group made for your project**

In our last group meeting our group met and discussed changiing our alternative meeting time to Friday 3:30-5:30. We all have python 3 installed. Together we installed the development environments, signed up for the mailing list, and joined the IRC chat. We need to confirm that everyone has their virtual environments set up properly. We started to look at "Easy Picking" tickets and came to the conclusion that there are not that many. We have decided to monitor Django over the weekend and decide if we will continue with Django or pick another project before our next meeting. 

Tickets that we are interested in include those that deal with translation errors. We need to clarify the meaning between the tags "Assigned" and "Accepted".

**What is the next thing that you (as an individual) will be working on (as part of your team project)?**

Me as an individual will be working on organizing our project repo and analyzing whether or not we will keep Django as our project by monitoring the "Easy Picking" tickets before our next meeting.

### Contributions (nothing new this week)

**Wikipedia**

1. [Edit character page for Appa](<https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Appa_(character)&oldid=825221947>) 

My contribution was to add a link to the first occurrence of Aang’s name. I chose to add this link because Appa is Aang’s sky bison, so it is important to have their connection readily available in the article. 

**Course Website**
