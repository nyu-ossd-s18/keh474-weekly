### Report on team project progress - concentrating on your own contributions to the team

This week our team was able to make our first [pull request](https://github.com/django/django/pull/9875) regarding ticket [#29274](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29274). "All checks have passed" and "This branch has no conflicts with the base branch". We are currently waiting on feedback.

During our meeting on Wednesday, Kenneth, Rohit, and I looked into how to check if the passwords in the old, smaller list were all in the new list. Rohit wrote a python script that added all of the passwords from both lists in a set so we ensured that not only did we have both old and new passwords, but that we also had no duplicates. On Wednesday night after our meeting, I researched the Django unit testing because I wanted our team to be able to make our pull request soon. I installed the dependencies for testing by following the instructions for testing on the [Django Unit Tests page](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/) and ran the tests on my Mac. I ran both the unit tests covering our change and the whole suite of tests. I found no errors but when my teammates ran the tests on their computers, they skipped more tests but ran the same number of tests that I did. The difference may be due to the fact that Jessica and Rohit do not have Macs.

Our team was also unsure if we would need to run more specific unit tests to ensure that the validator was working. I read the source code for the [logic of CommonPasswordValidator](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/django/blob/master/django/contrib/auth/password_validation.py) and the [test module](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/django/blob/master/tests/auth_tests/test_validators.py) and determined that according to the way the tests are set up, we would not need to run more specific tests, but it was strange that the only two specific cases that were being checked were 'godzilla' and 'a-safe-password'.

I reached out to Brenton Cleeland on the [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/django-developers/oMWLVK5kTpI/discussion) to ask if it would be beneficial to write more specific unit tests and James Bennett responded within the hour saying that we can randomly select lines everytime we run the test to ensure that it works. Our group also determined that we can also write another python script to check all of the passwords.
