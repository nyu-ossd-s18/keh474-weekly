### Report on team project progress - concentrating on your own contributions to the team

This week has been mainly dedicated to triaging issues on Django's ticket website so that myself, Kenneth, and Shiyang can all have commits on our fork since our first ticket did not need a lot of commits in order to make the change. We have been having diffuculty finding new issues however, since the tickets seem to be slow. We experienced this problem in the beginning of our project as well.

During our meeting during class on Tuesday, we triaged tickets and made a plan for moving forward with our project. Jessica and I ran into problems syncing our fork with the Django repo, but I managed to resolve the issue by recloning our fork, re-adding the remote for the Django repo, and then doing a git fetch and git merge.

During our group meeting on Wednesday we also triaged tickets. Django was still dead, but we managed to find ticket [#29122](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29122) which involves changing the font for Persian/Farsi. I claimed it so we would not have to risk losing the ticket to someone else. Our group started our power point for our presentation and made a more detailed plan for the rest of the semester. Rohit suggested that we could write more unit tests for the CommonPasswordValidator for ticket 29274 in order for the rest of the group to get more commits, so we considered doing that.

Our group met an additional time on Friday and I wrote the minutes file. Tim Graham reached out to us in regards to ticket [#29122](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29122) and said that the ticket has the status of "someday/maybe", it is "premature to assign the ticket". He told us to suggest solutions on the [Developer's Mailing List](https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DevelopersMailingList). We also discussed Django's BSD License and the fact that the license file does not explicitly state that it is a BSD license. We talked about changing the documentation for this, but decided against it after looking at other projects with a BSD License. In regards to writing new units tests for the CommonPasswordValidator, we have also decided to not move forward to that because after re-reading the comment from James Bennett, he suggested randomly trying lines on every test run, not writing new unit tests. 

Our [pull request](https://github.com/django/django/pull/9875) for ticket 29274 was merged 6 days ago on 16 April 2018.
