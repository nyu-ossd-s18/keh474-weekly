### Code Triage

So far, my experience with Code Triage has been a good one. There is a lot of information on how to get started and the ability to sort through projects by language is nice.

**Projects I have signed up for**
* [Coala](https://github.com/coala/coala)
* [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)

**Bugs/Issues I have examined**

1. pip interprets Matplotlib dev version as stable #7962 (**Matplotlib**)

This issue was opened on Jan 27, 2017 and there was discussion with some other people and one of the owners of the repo that same day. I like how the issue is detailed and there are suggestions of a fix from other contributers. Everyone was polite and the "Release critical" and "upstream fix required" tags were added.

2. Add strict .coafile mode #3987 (**Coala**)

This issue was opened on March 24, 2017 via gitter. It is nice to see that people are talking about problems on gitter.  An owner of the repo replied that same day and the discussion was very casual. A contributer opened a different issue that is aimed at tackeling this issue, but I do not think that it was a good idea. Duplicate issues cause confusion. The second issue, *ConfigurationGathering: Add strict mode #4011* was opened March 28, 2017 and is marked as stale. The original issue has not been commented on since March 28, 2017. One of the issues should be closed and the problem should be addressed even if that just means closing the issue.
