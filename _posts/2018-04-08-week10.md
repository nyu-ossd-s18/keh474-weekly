### A reflection on the invited talk: what do you think about the Google's approach to open source

Danna's talk about Google was informative. I enjoyed the beginning where she discussed open source at Google and the various projects, tools, languages, and frameworks that Google is involved with. I was suprised to learn that a company as large as Google is invlolved in so many open source projects including tensorflow, abseil, and boringssl. Google's beleif that "open is better" falls in line with what we have been discussing throughout the entire course and with what is written in [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html). What I found personally impressive is that the "open is better" philosophy isn't just talk at Google. The fact that they have a rotating position of reaching out to and responding to the open source community with a response time of about 2 days is great. Another thing that Danna mentioned in regards to Google's approach to open source is the importance of the code of conduct. Google takes this very seriously since it's existance is important for keeping the community a productive and nice space for collaboration. 

### Report on team project progress - concentrating on your own contributions to the team

This week our team made a lot of progress because we located issues that we are able to tackle. I helped search for issues during our meeting on Wednesday and Jessica was able to claim [ticket 29274](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29274) so that our group could work on it. We discovered that members of the community label the tickets, so there seem to be very few "easy pickings" tickets because they have not been labled yet. When we searched for tickets with no patches, we were able to find a lot of tickets that could qualify as "easy pickings". I have also been monitoring the IRC chat, but it seems to deal less with contributing to Django and more with actually using Django. I will continue monitoring it in case there is anything of use or if we need to reach out and ask for help. I was absent for our meeting during class, but I have read the minutes notes and am prepared to help resolve this issue with the group.

### Visit the [code of conduct document for the Go project](https://golang.org/conduct). Read the document and explain the benefits of having such a document for a project. Do you think other projects would benefit from having such document? 

There are several benefits to having a code of conduct document. Firstly, such a document creates what the golang.org conduct page describes as a "baseline standard of behavior". This allows different people to communicate effectively since the behavior standards are written out. Secondly, a code of conduct is good for conflict resolution and other behaviors such as discussing topics that are irrelevant to the project. Conflict within a community derails from productivity, so it is important to have a mechanism to reach a resolution. This is especially important for a community of volunteers because an unhealthy environment will cause people to leave. Thirdly, a code of conduct is good for promoting diversity and creating a friendly, welcoming environment. If a community is welcoming, it is more likely to bring in and retain members.

I think that other projects would benefit from having a code of conduct because not only does it foster a healthy, welcoming environment, but it also helps deal with situations when conflics arise. For example, Django has a code of conduct, and it is nice to know as a new contributer that everyone I speak to when asking for help or submitting pull requests for review will be patient and respectful.

### Does the project that your team is working on have a code of conduct document. If so, post the link to it.

Yes, Django has a [code of conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/) document
